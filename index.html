            <h1>WELCOME TO CEDIE WEBPAGE</h1>
            <p>
                My name is Mychael Lance Cedric C. Ferrer, and I am currently a second-year college student at the College of Education, majoring in Garments, Fashion, and Design. I was born on December 3, 2004, at Mandaluyong City Medical Center. My mother is Precy C. Ferrer, while my father left when I was still young. I grew up with two stepbrothers, Dave and James.

When I was four years old, my mother enrolled me in daycare. I had to repeat a year before I could move up to the next level. My mother and my aunt served as my guardians. According to my mother, I often got into fights with my classmates because of my anger issues, and I would cry every time she left me at the daycare center.

At six years old, I entered Grade 1. I was nervous because our teacher was very strict. I was always late, so she often punished me by making me stand in front of the class and apologize for being late.

My elementary years were memorable because I had many friends. I became an honor student in Science, although Math was always my weakness. Among my closest friends were Daniela and Kim. We loved spending time together, and we even sold siomai to help Daniela with their products. Eventually, we lost communication as we grew older and found different circles of friends, especially after Daniela transferred to another school.
